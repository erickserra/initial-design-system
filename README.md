# Initial design system

A Starter project for design systems, using React, Typescript, TailwindCSS, Radix-ui, Storybook, and some Storybook add-ons. 




## How to run

#### NPM

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

or if you are using yarn

#### YARN

```bash
yarn install && yarn dev
```
## Storybook

With the project installed, open bash and run ``` npm run storybook ``` and wait for the documentation at https://localhost:6006 . 
## Running Tests
To run tests, first make sure that your storybook is running at your localhost and then run the following command

```bash
  npm run test-storybook
```
or if you are using yarn
```bash
  yarn test-storybook
```


###### NOTE: The runner assumes that your Storybook is running on port 6006. If you're running Storybook in another port, either use --url or set the TARGET_URL before running your command like: ``` yarn test-storybook --url http://localhost:9009 ```
